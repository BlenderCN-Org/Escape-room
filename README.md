# Escape room
This project is a escape room in VR built in Unreal Engine 4 for my first ISP and has never been released so you're going to need UE4 in order to play it.
The game should work for both Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. I haven't tested out the Vive in a while but it still should work.

### Hints 
There is 3 puzzles in the game and all of my friends were pretty quick to figure out the first two puzzles however they found the 3rd puzzle to be difficult. The hints I gave them were "This puzzle cannot be solved in the real world" and "Where did the blue dot go?". With those hints everyone was able to beat the game given enough time.

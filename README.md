# This is a game that I worked on for my 1st year ISP
It's a escape room in VR built in Unreal Engine 4 and has never been released so you're going to need UE4 in order to play it.
I know the game works on the HTC Vive but I never had access to a Oculus Rift to test on so I don't know if the game will be playable.

## How to play
1. Download UE4 https://www.unrealengine.com
1. One you have UE4 installed then you can clone (for some reason downloading it doesn't work) the repo, then open 'ISP.uproject'.
1. Once this has been completed you should be within UE4 and be able to click the play button in the upper right hand corner.

### Hints 
There is 3 puzzles in the game and all of my friends were pretty quick to figure out the first two puzzles however they found the 3rd puzzle to be difficult. The hints I gave them were "This puzzle cannot be solved in the real world" and "Where did the blue dot go?". With those hints everyone was able to beat the game given enough time.

")

# Description
This project is an escape room in VR built in Unreal Engine 4 for my first ISP and has never been released so you're going to need UE4 in order to play it.
The game should work for both Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. I haven't tested out the Vive in a while but it still should work.

# Controls 
### Rift controls 
Teleport by clicking in on the controls

Triggers close your hand and when your hand is inside of an object you grab the object

### Vive controls
I haven't tested the vive in a long while but this is from what I remember the controls to be
Teleport by clicking in on the circular button

Triggers close your hand and when your hand is inside of an object you grab the object

# How to solve the puzzles

#### First puzzle
You solve this puzzle by placing the rocks on the buttons according to the picture above the table. The two rectangles are the table and the bed to your front and left. The Xs are the buttons you need to put the rocks on


#### Second puzzle
You solve this puzzle by taking the white object that was given to you after the first puzzle and holding up above the bloody feet in front of the table. The letters it's supposed to not cover are 'U' and 'P' spelling "up" up is supposed to give you the clue to look at the blue dot that just spawned. 
I don't love how this puzzle was implemented because the way that it's built you're allowed to hold up the white object in any orientation rather than the orientation that shows the word up


#### Third Puzzle
This puzzle isn't difficult to solve it just takes a while to solve it. The way to solve it is to stick your head through the wall that the blue dot went through. Once you've done that teleport through the wall and you've solved the third puzzle.
